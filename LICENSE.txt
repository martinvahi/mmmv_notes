Everything in the mmmv_notes is BSD license compatible.
There are NO GPL related restrictions.

The licenses are a mixture of BSD, MIT, public domain, but
some parts may also have Apache License or Mozilla license
or Eclipse license. The idea is that everything in the mmmv_notes
is usable in closed source software without revealing the
source and without paying any license fees.
