 mmmv_utilities  
===========================================================================

The mmmv_utilities is a collection of small, simplistic, tools, scripts,
that aim to facilitate daily tasks of a UNIX-like operating system
power-user.

The second reason, why this scripts collection is beneficial, 
is that the scripts serve as Bash and console tools related 
code examples, "live notes". The 

    ./doc

contains some hints about how to combine the 
different utilities from the 

    ./src

to get the maximum benefit from them.
Thank You for studying the mmmv_utilities :-)
