The encryption related settings are at the start of the scripts 

    ./bin/decrypt.bash
    ./bin/encrypt.bash

Additional keys can be generated by editing and running 

    ./bonnet/bin/editable_script_for_gneerating_cryptokeys.bash

The 

    ./bin/decrypt.bash
    ./bin/encrypt.bash
    ./bonnet/bin/editable_script_for_gneerating_cryptokeys.bash

have been hastily written in about 5 hours on 2022_07_16, so
there might be still bugs, but as of 2022_07_16 the Ruby code that 
implements the encryption tools, the mmmv_crypt_t1, has been stable for years.
