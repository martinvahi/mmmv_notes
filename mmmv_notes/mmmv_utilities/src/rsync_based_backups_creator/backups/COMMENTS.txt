This ( ./../backups ) is where the folders with backup copies,
i.e. backup bins, will be automatically created.

If one decreases the value of the I_NUMBER_OF_BACKUP_VERSIONS 
in the ../create_backup.bash, then one might want to, but is
not necessarily obligated to, save some storage space by deleting 
the backup bins that are not in use.

The numbering of backup bins that are in use, always starts
from zero. For example, 
if I_NUMBER_OF_BACKUP_VERSIONS==3 , 
then the suffixes of the backup bins are: 0, 1, 2 . 
If I_NUMBER_OF_BACKUP_VERSIONS==5 , 
then the suffixes of the backup bins are: 0, 1, 2 , 3, 4 .
