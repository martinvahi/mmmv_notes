The download part actually works and the compile part 
is ready for testing, but the 2016_12 verson of the LLVM requires quite
new version of CMake, which in 2016_12 is not part of the
openSUSE Linux distro and the compilation of that CMake
ran into trouble with the openSUSE flawed package collection,
where the openssl has linking problems. That's why the 
script is not fully tested.
