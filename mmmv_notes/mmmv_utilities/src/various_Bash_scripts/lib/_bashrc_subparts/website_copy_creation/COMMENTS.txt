The 

    ./_bashrc_subpart_create_redirection_HTML
    ./_bashrc_subpart_wget

are meant to be included/sourced to the ~/.bashrc . The 

    ./redirection_page_template_01.html

can be re-generated by using an alias from the 

    ./_bashrc_subpart_create_redirection_HTML

At deployment setup the 

    ./redirection_page_template_01.html

is expected to be generated/created into the same folder that
contains the  

    ./_bashrc_subpart_create_redirection_HTML
