The files in this folder are meant to be subparts of 

    $HOME/.bashrc
    # on console referred to as 
    ~/.bashrc

The $HOME/.bashrc is a Bash script that gets
executed at the start of a Bash session.
SSH clients might fail to log in, if the $HOME/.bashrc
has any console output, because any console output 
at initial login is seen by the SSH client as 
a server side error condition. An "exit" clause 
at the $HOME/.bashrc ends the Bash session and 
therefore prevents login. That's just a reminder,
not a tutorial :-)
