# A lot of code has been just copy-pasted from the
# Kibuvits Ruby Library (hereafter: KRL) and slightly modified.
# Think of it as boilerplate. You may want to look for a string
# "KRL_based_boilerplate_end" to naviate to the end of that boilerplate.
#
# This version of the KRL _probably_ works with Ruby 2.3 and 2.7.4 and 3.0,
# but it will not work with Ruby 2.4.x, because Ruby 2.4.x prints
# a warning about Fixnum, Bignum obsolence to stderr and
# some of the code in this file checks that there is nothing at
# the stderr and quits the moment it finds something at the stderr.

# Most Ruby versions prior to Ruby version 3.2.0

      #  The variant field determines the layout of the UUID.  That is,
      #  the interpretation of all other bits in the UUID depends
      #  on the setting of the bits in the variant field.  As such,
      #  it could more accurately be called a type field; we retain
      #  the original term for compatibility. The variant field
      #  consists of a variable number of the most significant bits
      #  of octet 8 of the UUID.
      #
      #  The following table lists the contents of the variant field, where
      #  the letter "x" indicates a "don't-care" value.
      #
      #  Msb0  Msb1  Msb2  Description
      #
      #   0     x     x    Reserved, NCS backward compatibility.

      # To minimize confusion about bit assignments within octets, the UUID
      # record definition is defined only in terms of fields that are

   # uses a temporary string of length
   # 'something_very_long'.'short_string_1'

   #
   # Believe it or not, but as of January 2012 the speed difference
   # in PHP can be at least about 20% and in Ruby about 50%.
   # Please do not take my word on it. Try it out yourself by
   # modifying this function and assembling strings of length
   # 10000 from single characters.
   #
   # This here is probably not the most optimal solution, because
   # within the more optimal solution the the order of
   # "concatenation glue placements" depends on the lengths
   # of the tokens/strings, but as the analysis and "gluing queue"
   # assembly also has a computational cost, the version
   # here is almost always more optimal than the totally
   # naive version.

   #
   # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_people
   # http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA000.pdf
   #
   # This way every byte can be represented by
   # a single existing Unicode character without
   # any branching, jumping, over/around Unicode "holes",
   # unassigned Unicode code points.
   #
   # A single byte is armoured as 2 byte Unicode
   # character, but this approach saves data
   # volume at later steps.
   #
   # For example, 255_base_10 is armoured to
   # 2 characters in hex, the FF_base_16, but
   # it is a single character, if armoured to Yi.
   # If the Yi characters are encrypted,
   # character-by-charcter and the number of
   # characters that the encryption function
   # returns is at least double the input data volume of the
   # encryption function, then minimizing
   # the amount of characters at armouring
   # step yields a considerable winning.

# The class Kibuvits_krl171bt4_htoper_t1 is a namespace for general, simplistic,
# functions that read their operands from hashtables or store the
# result to hashtables. The methods of the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_htoper_t1 somewhat
# resemble operands that operate on hashtable values. The main idea is
# to abstract away the fetching of values from hashtables and the
# storing of computation results back to the hashtables.

#==========================================================================

# The Kibuvits_krl171bt4_gstatement instances represents an
# EBNF style statement like MY_GSTATEMENT_TYPE:==MOUSE MOUSEJUMP* CAT?
#
# The Kibuvits_krl171bt4_gstatement acts as a container for other
# instances of the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_gstatement. The overall idea
# behind the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_gstatement is that if all of the
# terms and terminals at the right side of the :== are represented
# by elements that reside inside the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_gstatement based
# container, then one can generate code by using the
# Decorator design pattern. One just has to call the to_s
# method of the container to get the generated code. :-)
#
# The EBNF spec that is given to the container at initialization
# detetermins the internal structure of the container.
#
# The set of supported operators in the spec is {|,?,+,*},
# but a limitation is that only one level of braces
# is supported, i.e. nesting of braces is not allowd, and
# none of the operators, the {|,?,+,*}, may be used
# outside of braces, except when the right side of the
# EBNF style spec does not contain any braces.
#
# Examples of supported, i.e. valid, specifications:
#         UUU:== A |B |C
#         UUU:==(A |B |C )
#         UUU:== A?|B*|C+
#         UUU:==(A?|B*|C+)
#         UUU:==(A )B  C
#         UUU:==(A |B) C
#         UUU:== A (B|C+) D # gets autocompleted to "(A)(B|C+)(D)"
#
# Examples of UNsupported, i.e. INvalid, specifications:
#         UUU:== A  B |C
#         UUU:==(A  B |C )
#         UUU:== A?|B  C
#         UUU:==(A )B  C+
#         UUU:== A (B|C+) D+
#
# The reason, why the "UUU:== A (B|C+) D+" is not supported
# is that the autocompletion is not advanced enough to handle the
# operator after D.
# The reason, why the " UUU:== A  B |C" is not supported is
# that it actually entails "UUU:==(A B)|C", where the | operator
# is outside of the brackets. If multiple nesting is not
# allowed, one can not autocomple it to "UUU:==((A B)|C)".
#
# There's also a limitation that on the right side of the ":=="
# each term/terminal can be used only once.
#
# NOT supported:
#         UUU:==(A B A+)
#
# The reason for that limitation
# is that later, when one inserts elements that correspond to
# the terms and terminals, one is not able to determine, to
# which of the terminals the insertable element must correspond to.
# For example, in the case of the "UUU:==(A B A+)", it's not
# possible to determine, if it should represent/generate code for
# the first "A" or the second "A".

# The "fileutils" gem/library MUST NOT BE USED, because
# it does not come precompiled with the Ruby distribution
# and its installation requires operating system specific
# compilation, which  prevents parts of the the KRL from running
# on Windows and JRuby. JRuby is necessary for using KRL
# form Java. The JRuby is used for running IDE addons/plugins
# and for using the KRL text processing routines for custom
# Java applications.

   # The s_checks_specification is a commaseparated list of the following
   # flagstrings, but in a way that no conflicting flagstrings reside in
   # the list:
   #
   # exists, does_not_exist, is_directory, is_file,
   #     readable,     writable, executable,     deletable
   # not_readable, not_writable, not_executable
   #
   # An example of a conflicting set is "does_not_exist,writable", because
   # a non-existing file can not possibly be be writable. However,
   # a commandset of "exists,writable" is considered non-conflicting and
   # equivalent to a commandset of "writable", because a folder or a file
   # must exist to be writable.
   #
   # For the sake of helping the software developer to detect
   # logic mistakes, or just plain coding mistakes, a commandset
   # of "does_not_exist,not_readable" is considered to be conflicting, even
   # though it is not conflicting in the real world sense.

   # The idea is that if the process rights owner
   # is the owner of the file, then the result will be
   # 0700, but if the file has been made writable to
   # the group of the file owner and the chmod-er is
   # not the owner but someone from the group of the
   # owner, then the access rights would be 0770 and
   # if everybody has been given the right to write to
   # the file or folder, then the access rights would
   # be 0777.
   #
   # The motive behind such a graceful access rights
   # modification is that, if a folder with a lot of private
   # data were to be deleted, then the delete operation
   # can take considerable amount of time.
   # In that case the temporary chmod(0777) might reveal the
   # private data to users that otherwise would be
   # banned from accessing it.
   #
   # However, if the file or folder has the access rights of 0777 or 0770,
   # and the process access rights are that of the file owner's,
   # then it will not chmod the access rights to the 0700.
   # The rationale is that if a file or folder
   # has been made  to everyone, then there's no
   # point of denying access to it.

# The class Kibuvits_krl171bt4_formula exists mainly for duck typing.
#
# Everything is stored to the public field, which is a
# hash table, and the main idea is that a formula consists of
# components that are described by 2 variables in the hashtable:
#
# x) An array of other formulaes, integers or symbols, like the Pi.
#
# x) A string that is a name of the function that ties the
#    array elements together. For example, it might be multiplication,
#    werhe the order of elements in the array is relevant in cases
#    of matrixes, or the function might be summation, where usually
#    the order of arguments, in thins case, the array elements,
#    is not relevant.
#
# One calls the formula component that are described by the array and
# the string a formulicle. (It's a bit like the word: particle. The
# word "funclet" seems to be already used by other people for other
# denotates.)
#
# The format of the hashtable is simplistic enough to be read

# following boolean expression has the value of true:
#
#                       ( <Micky> OR <Donald> OR <Pluto> ) AND
#                   AND   <Swan> AND
#                   AND ( <Horse> OR <Mule> ) AND
#                   AND   <Frog> AND
#                   AND ( <Butterfly> OR <Beetle> )
#
# The chevrons denote a function that
# returns a boolean value.
#
# The other part of the semantics of the ht_dependency_relations
# is that the order of the names in the arrays is
# important, because the replacement dependencies
# are searched by starting from the smallest
# index. For example, in the case of the illustration,
# if the Pluto is available and the Donald
# is available, but the Micky is not available, then
# the Donald is used, because its index in the
# array is smaller than that of the Pluto.
#
# The previous, boolean, example was equivalent to a situation,
# where the dependency fulfillment has only 2 values,
#       "met"  ,  "unmet",
# i.e.  "yes"  ,   "no",
# i.e.    1   and   0,
# i.e. "true"  ,  "false
# and the fulfillment threshold equals one.
#
# A generalized version of that is that there is a range of
# floating point numbers, [0,n], where 1<=n, and the question, whether
# all dependencies have been met, is equivalent to a question:
# do all of the dependencies have their availability value
# equal to or greater than the threshold?
#
# For example, in the case of the classical, boolean,
# version, the n==1, i.e. the range of floating point numbers
# is [0,1], and all dependencies are considered to be met, if
# all of the dependencies have their availability value
# "greater than" or "equal to" one. That is to say, in the
# case of the boolean version the threshold equals 1 .
#
# If the ht_dependency_relations does not contain any keys,
# then all dependencies are considered to be met and the
# threshold is considered to be reached.

   # ht_dependencies --- The keys match with the keys of the
   #                     ht_dependency_relations, except when the
   #                     ht_dependency_relations has at least one key and the
   #                     ht_cycle_detection_opmem contains the s_dependent_object_name
   #                     as one of its keys. The values are the names of the
   #                     dependencies that got selected.
   #
   #            fd_x --- Availability, which is of a floating point number type.
   #                     fd_x equals with the maximum threshold that
   #                     the availability of all of the selected objects
   #                     is equal to or greater, regardless of wether
   #                     fd_x is greater than or equal to the fd_threshold.
   #
   #  If the ht_cycle_detection_opmem does contain the s_dependent_object_name
   #  as one of its keys, then the ht_dependencies will be an empty hashtable.
   #
   # The fd_threshold must be greater than or equal to 0.
   #
   # The ht_objects has object names as keys and the objects as values.
   # The objects in the ht_objects must have a
   # method that corresponds to the s_or_sym_method.
   #
   # If the s_or_sym_method returns boolean values, then the
   # boolean values are interpreted so that the boolean true equals
   # 1 and the boolean false equals 0. The method that is
   # denoted by the s_or_sym_method must accept exactly two
   # parameters, which must be optional. First of the parameters is
   # of type Hash and optionally has a name of ht_cycle_detection_opmem.
   # The second of the parameters is the fd_threshold. The keys
   # of the ht_cycle_detection_opmem are object names and the
   # values of the ht_cycle_detection_opmem  are the objects.
   #
   # Cyclic dependencies ARE allowed, but if the availability
   # of the ht_objects[s_dependent_object_name] is determined
   # by its own availability, then the fd_x==0.
   # Due to the substitutions within the ht_dependency_relations
   # the existance of cyclic dependencies is dynamic, determined
   # at runtime. The cyclic paths that consist of more than
   # 2 nodes are detected by using the ht_cycle_detection_opmem.
   #
   # If the ht_objects[s_dependent_object_name] does not
   # depend on any of the other instances that are listed
   # in the ht_objects, i.e. if the
   # ht_dependency_relations.keys.size==0, then the
   # ar_get_availability_value(...) returns
   # ht_objects[s_dependent_object_name].method(s_or_sym_method).call
   #
   # The fd_threshold is related to substitutions.
   # For example, if
   #
   #     ht_dependency_relations=Hash["ob_2", ["ob_3","ob_4"] ]
   #
   # and
   #
   #     fd_threshold==60
   #
   # and
   #
   #     ht_objects["ob_2"].method(s_or_sym_method).call == 42
   #     ht_objects["ob_3"].method(s_or_sym_method).call == 73
   #     ht_objects["ob_4"].method(s_or_sym_method).call == 99
   #
   # i.e.
   #     "ob_2" => ["ob_3","ob_4"]
   #       42         73     99
   #
   # then the fd_x==73 , because 42 is smaller than the fd_threshold,
   # but the first substitution, the ht_objects["ob_2"], has an availability
   # value of 73 and 60<=73 . The reason, why the availability value of the
   # ht_objects["ob_3"] is used in stead of the availability value of the
   # ht_objects["ob_4"], is that the substitution order is determined by the
   # array indices, not availability values.
   #
   # Some code examples, illustrations, reside
   # within the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_dependencymetrics_t1 selftests.
   #
   # It's OK for the ht_objects to miss some of the keys that
   # are represented within the ht_dependency_relations either as keys or
   # parts of the ht_dependency_relations values. The availability of instances
   # that are not represented within the ht_objects, is considered 0 (zero).

   # The values of the ht_grammar are expected to be an integers that

   # The value that is greater than or equal to 0 indicates the

   # means that at least one file name is expected right after

   # The ht_args is the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_argv_parser.run output.
   #
   # The idea behind the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_argv_parser.normalize_parsing_result
   # is that if there are multiple console arguments that actually are
   # synonyms, for example, "-f", "--file", "--files", then to simplify
   # the code that has to act upon the console arguments, it makes
   # sense to converge the values. For example, in the case of the
   # "-f", "--file", "--files" one might want to collect all of the
   # file paths to a single array that resides in one certain location
   # in the ht_args, let's say next to "--file". In that case, the
   # ht_normalization_specification has "--file" as its key and
   # an array of its synonyms as the value that corresponds to the
   # "--file": ["-f","--files"].
   #
   # It's OK to place the keys of the  ht_normalization_specification
   # to the array of values, but it won't change anything, because
   # a thing x is considered to be its own synonym.
   #
   # Since the normalizing changes the ht_args content,
   # the numbers of the console arguments should be verified prior to
   # normalization.

   # A word of warning is that unlike configurations utilities,
   # i.e. settings dialogs, configurations files do not check the
   # consistency of the configuration and do not assist the user.
   # For example, in the case of a configurations dialog, it's possible
   # to change the content of one menu based on the selection of the other.
   #
   # Configurations string format example:
   #
   #-the-start-of-the-ht_parse_configstring-usage-example-DO-NOT-CHANGE-THIS-LINE
   # i_error_code=500
   # s_formal_explanation=HEREDOC
   #          Internal Error. The server encountered an unexpected condition
   #          which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
   # HEREDOC_END
   #
   # s_true_explanation=HEREDOC
   #
   #          The reason, why this software does not work the way
   #          You expected it to work, is that the developers obeyed their
   #          boss in stead of using their own heads.
   #
   #          Be prepared that in the future You'll get the same kind of
   #          quality from those developers, because they are willing to
   #          do a lousy job just to avoid getting dismissed. Probably
   #          they are going to keep on doing that till their retirement.
   #
   # HEREDOC_END
   #
   # Anything that is not part of heredoc and is not part of the
   # traditional assignment expression, is a comment. Equals signs
   # within comments must be escaped like \=
   #
   #     This\= 42 is a comment line.
   #     This0 = is an assignment line.
   #     This1 = is an assignment line that contains  = within its value.
   #     This2 = is an assignment line that contains \= within its value.
   #
   # demovar=HEREDOC Spooky
   #     The default heredoc end tag is the HEREDOC_END, but
   #     by declaring a custom, temporary, heredoc end tag it
   #     is possible to use the HEREDOC_END within the heredoc text.
   # Spooky
   #
   # demovar2=HEREDOC
   #     The heredoc format allows to use the keyword HEREDOC as
   #     part of the value. The reason, why the name of the variable
   #     here is demovar2 in stead of just demovar is that the
   #     variable demovar has been declared in the previous demo bloc
   #     and no variable is allowed to be declared more than once.
   # HEREDOC_END
   #
   # wow=HEREDOC42
   #     This line is not part of the heredoc, because
   #     HEREDOC42 is not a keyword. This line is just a comment.
   # HEREDOC_END
   #
   # wow2=HEREDOC
   #     HEREDOC is usually a keyword, but it is not a keyword,
   #     if it resides in the value part of the heredoc.
   # HEREDOC_END
   #
   # If the HEREDOC is not to the right of an unescaped equals sign,
   # then it is not interpreted as a key-word and is part of a comment.
   #
   # Actually this very same string string fragment is part of the
   # selftests. The ht_parse_configstring selftest code extracts it
   # from the KRL ruby file, where the ht_parse_configstring is defined.
   #
   #-the-end---of-the-ht_parse_configstring-usage-example-DO-NOT-CHANGE-THIS-LINE
   #
   # The motive behind such a comment-sign-free configurations file
   # format is that usually parameter explanation comments have
   # more characters than parameter declarations themselves and
   # by making declarations "special" and comments "common", the "average"
   # amount of compulsory boiler-plate characters decreases.
   # Some of the credits go to the authors of the YAML specification,
   # because the YAML files are truly human friendly, if compared to
   # the JSON and the dinosaur of structured text formats, the XML.
   #
   # The recommended file extension of text files that are
   # in the format of the Kibuvits_krl171bt4_configfileparser_t1 is "txt_krlconfig_t1".

   # General explanation resides at
   #
   # http://longterm.softf1.com/specifications/hash_functions/plaice_hash_function/
   #
   # A few references to inspirations:
   # http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/
   # http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~orrd/SHAvite-3/
   #
   #
   # A few ideas, how to increase the computational expense of
   # deriving the input string from the hash function output:
   #
   # idea_1) Mimic classical, cryptographically strong,
   #         hash functions that use XOR, except that
   #         in stead of using the bitwise XOR, TXOR is used.
   #         http://longterm.softf1.com/specifications/txor/
   #
   # idea_2) Substitution boxes that collide some of the
   #         elements in their domain.
   #         (offers more "originals" for the hash function
   #          output, therefore increases the likelihood of
   #          collisions, but makes it harder to derive exact
   #          input from the output);
   #
   # idea_3) A whole, cyclic, maze of data flows that
   #         have been constructed from idea_1 and idea_2.
   #         The maze might have the shape of a square that
   #         has been recursively divided to smaller squares by
   #         horizontal and vertical bisections. Cross-sections
   #         of lines form graph nodes.
   #
   # idea_5) Colliding probability of
   #         broken_hash_algorithm_1 and
   #         broken_hash_algorithm_2 can be decreased
   #         by conjunction:
   #
   #         far_more_secure_hash_function(s_data) =
   #             = broken_hash_algorithm_1(s_data).concat(
   #               broken_hash_algorithm_2(s_data))
   #
   # idea_6) To make sure that input strings
   #         "cal", "call" and  "wall"
   #         produce different hashes, the hash
   #         has to contain the whole alphabet
   #         and something has to be done with
   #         character counts. To hide the original
   #         message, the original message has to be
   #         extended with characters that are not
   #         in the original message. To hide
   #         Names and number of sentences in the
   #         original message, all characters should
   #         be downcased. On the other hand,
   #         "Wall" and "wall" should produce
   #         different hash values.
   #
   #
   # The unit of the i_headerless_hash_length is "number of characters"
   # and it must be at least 1. Hash format:
   #
   #     <header>|<headerless hash of length i_headerless_hash_length>
   #
   # The <header> does not contain the character "|".
   # Header format: <protocol name and version>:<i_minimum_n_of_rounds>
   #
   # The 300 characters per headerless hash is roughly 300*14b~4200b
   # The 30  characters per headerless hash is roughly  30*14b~ 420b
   # Approximately 7 (seven) characters should be enough to
   # hide the s_in from the NSA for 20 years, prior to the year 2150.
   # For security reasons the minimum value for the i_minimum_n_of_rounds
   # should be 40, but for file checksums it can be 1.
   # The i_minimum_n_of_rounds is part of the parameters only
   # to make it possible to increase the strength of the
   # hash, should the extra number of rounds be enough to
   # compensate design vulnerabilities.
   #
   # In addition to byte endianness CPU-s vary in
   # bit endianness (order of bits in a byte).
   #
   #     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering
   #
   # The conversion of bitstream to text is a complex
   # problem and this hash function has been designed to AVIOID
   # solving that problem in cases, where the conversion
   # has been already performed by programming language stdlib.
   # It is discouraged to use this function for calculating
   # file checksums, because other, bitstream oriented,
   # hash function implementations are a lot faster than
   # the implementation of this hash function.

      # is changed by unrolling the hash function from the
      # input datastream tail to somewhere in the middle, replacing the

      #
      #     hash(s_secret+s_publicly_known_text+s_secret)
      #
      # A way to do that, approximately, "roughly", is to

      # is covered by the fact that the tail part, the s_secret part,
