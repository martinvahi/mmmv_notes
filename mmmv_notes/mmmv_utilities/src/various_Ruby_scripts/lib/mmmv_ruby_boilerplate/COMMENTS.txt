The 

    ./<optional date>mmmv_ruby_boilerplate_<some type>/<optional date>mmmv_ruby_boilerplate_<some type>.rb

is a copy-pasted and slightly edited pile 
of Kibuvits Ruby Library(KRL) code. 
It is meant to be used only in a role of a deployment deliverable. 
It is NOT meant to be edited or read for learning the KRL API. 
The KRL API should be learned/studied by reading the original KRL code.

The main purpose of this all-in-one KRL deployment code 
is to keep the directory structure of relatively self-contained 
quick-and-dirty hacks and/or small tooling scripts simple.
