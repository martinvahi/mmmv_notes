= SourceForge Shells and SFTP =

I (Martin.Vahi@softf1.com) as an author of this text file
intend to use it for copy-pasting, so I leave my 
own username and project names into the code examples.
The project names and user names at the code
examples must be customized to the particular case.
This text uses vimwiki syntax.

== The Shells ==

=== SSH key ===

The SourceForge shells use the classical, "ordinary",
SSH key setup, where at the client side
the SSH key is generated like

{{{
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "martinvahi@shell.sf.net" -f $HOME/.ssh/2021_10_14_generated_SourceForge_key_01.txt
    # The ssh-keygen will generate a key-pair, where the private key file, 
    # which is expected to stay at the $HOME/.ssh/
    # will be named 
    #
    #     2021_10_14_generated_SourceForge_key_01.txt
    #
    # and the public key file, which would normally go to 
    # the server side ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ,
    # will be named as 
    #
    #     2021_10_14_generated_SourceForge_key_01.txt.pub
    #
    # In the case of SourceForge the public key file is 
    # delivered to SourceForge by loging into the
    # the SourceForge web site and then giving it over 
    # the web interface.
}}}


=== SourceForge SSH Access ===

SourceForge uses temporary consoles, temporary shells, probably
some form of a temporary "jail"/"zone"/"virtual_appliance"/"container".
A command for creating a temporary "virtual_appliance":

{{{
    # Usernames and SSH keyfile names must be changed to Your case.
    ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/2021_10_14_generated_SourceForge_key_01.txt martinvahi@shell.sourceforge.net create
}}}

A command for logging into the temporary "virtual_appliance"(after its creation):

{{{
    # Usernames and SSH keyfile names must be changed to Your case.
    ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/2021_10_14_generated_SourceForge_key_01.txt martinvahi@shell.sourceforge.net
}}}


=== SFTP Access ===

As of 2023_03 the FileZilla 

    [[https://filezilla-project.org/]]

works really well with SourceFourge.
After creating the temporary "virtual_appliance" as described 
at the previous chapter, the SFTP parameters are:

{{{
    protocol: SFTP
    host: frs.sourceforge.net
    port: <the same as SSH> 22
    user: martinvahi  # must be changed to Your case
    FileZilla logon type: "Ask for password"
    FileZilla transfer mode: "Default"
    FileZilla charset: "Autodetect"
}}}

After the files have been uploaded with FileZilla:

{{{
    # Use the plain terminal to SSH into the temporary "virtual_appliance"
    # and at that temporary "virtual_appliance" console please do
    cd /home/frs/projects/YOURNICEPROJECTNAME/
    mv ~/fancy_file_that_got_uploaded_with_the_FileZilla.someextention ./
    # and then please use the classical mkdir, mv, etc. to
    # actually manage the set of folders and files that
    # are displayed at the SourceForge project files section/tab.
}}}
