The folder

    ./seeds

contains text files that contain a mixture of empty lines,
lines with a single URL, lines that are single-liner-comments 
that use "//" or "#" as the comment start string.
Any line can start or end with an an almost arbitrary number and 
combination of spaces and tabulation characters.

The seed files are meant to be used for booting the 
indexing of private search engine instances.

The seed files are in public domain.
