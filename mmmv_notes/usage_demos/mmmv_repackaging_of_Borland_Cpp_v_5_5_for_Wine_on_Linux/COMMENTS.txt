License Nuisance:
    The repackaged software has its own license, 
    which does not make sense in year 2023, because 
    the company, Borland, does not exist any more, 
    the repackaged software was legally downloadable and 
    usable for commercial purposes free of charge 
    back in the day, when Borland did exist, and 
    the successors of the Borland have 
    de facto (not necessarily de jure) abandoned 
    that software. The Bash scripts and other text files
    that have been created by the Martin.Vahi@softf1.com,

                      The Repackaged Software 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of 2023_03_21 the 

    ./bonnet/Borland_v_5_5_installer/freecommandLinetools.exe
    (SHA256: 433b44741f07f2ad673eb936511d498c5a6b7f260f98c4d9a6da70c41a56d855 )

can be downloaded from 

    https://archive.org/download/freecommandLinetools/freecommandLinetools.exe
    https://archive.org/details/freecommandLinetools

The 

    ./bonnet/Borland_v_5_5_installer/Using_the_Borland_5.pdf

has been downloaded from some archive of the wild-wild-web. According to the

    ./bonnet/Borland_v_5_5_installer/2000_02_16_borland_com_Announcement_of_Borland_Cpp_Compiler_version_5.5_t1.pdf

the 

    ./bonnet/Borland_v_5_5_installer/freecommandLinetools.exe

seems to be for Windows95/Windows98/WindowsNT/Windows2000. The installer, the

    ./bonnet/Borland_v_5_5_installer/freecommandLinetools.exe

has been tested to work with Wine on ("uname -a")

Linux terminal01 4.4.126-48-default #1 SMP Sat Apr 7 05:22:50 UTC 2018 (f24992c) x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

During the installation the Wine may attempt to download 
some version of Mono, which makes internet connectivity
an occasionally occurring prerequisite for running the installer. The 

    ./bonnet/Borland_v_5_5_installer/Using_the_Borland_5.pdf

is relatively useless. Majority of the documentation resides at

                              C:\Borland\BCC55\Help\bcb5tool.hlp
    # id est $HOME/.wine/drive_c/Borland/BCC55/Help/bcb5tool.hlp

which MIGHT be viewed with Wine by executing

    wine 'winhlp32.exe' 'C:\Borland\BCC55\Help\bcb5tool.hlp'

which is the core of the Bash script

    ./bin/display_Borland_Cpp_v_5_5_help_by_using_Wine_and_winhlp32_exe.bash

                         Package Scripts

The 

    ./bin/install_Borland_Cpp_v_5_5_for_Wine_on_Linux.bash

MIGHT give some useful feedback.
