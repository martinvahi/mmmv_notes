As of 2021_10 the WSL2 comes with a crippled Microsoft Linux kernel fork, 
where dynamic module loading is switched off by Microsoft and 
FUSE, consequently also SSHFS, which depends on FUSE, 
is NOT supported. On top of that the WSL2 requires
extra settings to get X applications to run on Windows.
The temporary storage space that is needed for 
converting a WSL Linux distribution from WSL1 to WSL2
roughly matches with the HDD image size of the distro.

Supposedly file operations are faster with WSL2 than they are with WSL1,
but as of 2021_10 I(Martin.Vahi@softf1.com) have not done
the measurements to confirm that.

The 

    ./WSL1_2_WSL2_upgrade_option_01_Microsoft_official

probably won't work and You might immediately start with 

    ./WSL1_2_WSL2_upgrade_option_02_hard_and_errorprone

Further details reside at 

    ./WSL1_2_WSL2_upgrade_option_02_hard_and_errorprone/COMMENTS.txt
