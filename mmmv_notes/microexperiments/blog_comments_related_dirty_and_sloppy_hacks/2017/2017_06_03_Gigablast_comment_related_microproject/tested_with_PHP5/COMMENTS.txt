This truly flimsy blog-comment-style demo, which downloads some 
query results from some search engine and then displays 
them by using custom HTML, is meant to be run by running the 

    ./src/index.php

which uses the 

    ./src/2017_06_03_Gigablast_related_comment_script_01_dot_bash.txt
    ./src/sirel_text_concatenation.php

as its sub-components. The demo stops working the moment
the search engine API changes "to a sufficiently great extent".
