This is the version 2 (v2) of the watershed based string concatenation
function. The version 1 resides in the ./kibuvits_str_concat_array_of_strings.rb

The v2 differs from the v1 by modifications that are inspired by 
the following comment that I received from ruby-core@ruby-lang.org

Hello,

I believe this is not worth it.
It seems you are not aware of String#<<, and that Ruby has mutable 
strings.
Which means there is no need for optimized repeated String#+, one can
just #dup the original (if needed) and use #<<(aliased to #concat)
afterwards.

In numbers:

n = 100000
String#concat: 0.11s user 0.01s system 97% cpu 0.115 total
watershed concatenation: 0.18s user 0.03s system 97% cpu 0.215 total
pseudo-watershed concatenation: 4.00s user 2.98s system 98% cpu 7.083 
total
plain loop concatenation: 7.33s user 7.54s system 98% cpu 15.081 total

n = 1000000,
String#concat: 0.88s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 0.896 total
watershed concatenation: 2.04s user 0.43s system 99% cpu 2.471 total

But maybe I missed something.

   # Believe it or not, but as of January 2012 the speed difference
   # in PHP can be at least about 20% and in Ruby about 50%.

   # modifying this function and assembling strings of length
   # 10000 from single characters.

   # within the more optimal solution the the order of
   # "concatenation glue placements" depends on the lengths
   # of the tokens/strings, but as the analysis and "gluing queue"
